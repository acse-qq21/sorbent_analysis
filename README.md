# Predicting the Sorbents Required for the Removal of Contaminants

The structure and function of each file in Code is as follows:

## Amount_sorbent.py 
• Contains the python code required to perform the sorbent mass calculations required for the batch treatment model and the sorbent mass calculations required for the continuous flow treatment model.

## Batch_Treatment.py 
• Contains the python code required for batch treatment model execution and computation.

## Continuous_Flow_Treatment.py 
• Contains the python code required for continuous flow treatment model execution and computation.

## main.py 
• Contains the user-interface code and the main functions to output the results.

## Batch_Treatment_Analysis.ipynb
• Python notebook to show the presentation and analysis of batch treatment models. The main analysis is the effect of different input parameters or different concentrations of sorbent on the results

## Continuous_Flow_Analysis.ipynb 
• Python notebook to show the presentation and analysis of continuous flow treatment models. The main analysis is the effect of different input parameters or different concentrations of sorbent on the results
